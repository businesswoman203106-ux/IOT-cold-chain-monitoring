# IoT Enabled Real-Time Environmental Monitoring for Smart Cold Chain Logistics

This project demonstrates a basic IoT-based system to monitor temperature
and environmental conditions in cold chain logistics in real time.

## Problem
Lack of real-time monitoring in cold chain logistics leads to spoilage of
perishable goods such as medicines and food products.

## Solution
An IoT-enabled monitoring system that continuously tracks temperature and
sends alerts when predefined limits are violated.

## Features
- Real-time temperature monitoring
- Threshold-based alert system
- Simple monitoring dashboard

## Components
- Simulated IoT sensor data
- Backend processing logic
- Basic UI dashboard
